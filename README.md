## Quickstart

![quickstart banner](./assets/quickstart-banner.png)

1. Install the Resonate Server & CLI

```shell
brew install resonatehq/tap/resonate
```

2. Install the Resonate SDK

```shell
pip install resonate-sdk
```

3. Write your first Resonate Function

A countdown as a loop. Simple, but the function can run for minutes, hours, or days, despite restarts.

```python
from resonate import Resonate, Context
from threading import Event

# Instantiate Resonate
resonate = Resonate.remote()

@resonate.register
def countdown(ctx: Context, count: int, delay: int):
    for i in range(count, 0, -1):
        # Run a function, persist its result
        yield ctx.run(ntfy, i)
        # Sleep
        yield ctx.sleep(delay)
    print("Done!")


def ntfy(_: Context, i: int):
    print(f"Countdown: {i}")


resonate.start() # Start Resonate threads
Event().wait()  # Keep the main thread alive
```

[Working example](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples/example-quickstart-py)

4. Start the server

```shell
resonate dev
```

5. Start the worker

```shell
python countdown.py
```

6. Run the function

Run the function with execution ID `countdown.1`:

```shell
resonate invoke countdown.1 --func countdown --arg 5 --arg 60
```

**Result**

You will see the countdown in the terminal

```shell
python countdown.py
Countdown: 5
Countdown: 4
Countdown: 3
Countdown: 2
Countdown: 1
Done!
```

**What to try**

After starting the function, inspect the current state of the execution using the `resonate tree` command. The tree command visualizes the call graph of the function execution as a graph of durable promises.

```shell
resonate tree countdown.1
```

Now try killing the worker mid-countdown and restarting. **The countdown picks up right where it left off without missing a beat.**

## Scheduling Functions

Resonate makes it simple to schedule functions to run automatically using cron expressions. The SDK provides a high-level `schedule()` API that handles all the complexity for you.

### Basic Scheduling

Schedule a function to run periodically:

```python
from resonate import Resonate, Context

resonate = Resonate.remote()

@resonate.register
def generate_report(ctx: Context, user_id: int) -> str:
    return f"Generated report for user {user_id}"

# Schedule to run every day at 9am
schedule = resonate.schedule(
    "daily_report",
    generate_report,
    "0 9 * * *",
    user_id=123
)
```

### Scheduling with Options

Customize timeout, tags, and other options:

```python
# Schedule with custom timeout and tags
schedule = resonate.options(
    timeout=3600,
    tags={"env": "production", "priority": "high"}
).schedule(
    "priority_sync",
    sync_data,
    "*/30 * * * *",  # Every 30 minutes
    source="api"
)
```

### Function-Level Scheduling

Schedule registered functions directly:

```python
@resonate.register
def cleanup_old_data(ctx: Context, days: int) -> int:
    # Cleanup logic here
    return deleted_count

# Schedule using the function instance
schedule = cleanup_old_data.schedule(
    "nightly_cleanup",
    "0 2 * * *",  # Every day at 2am
    days=30
)
```

### Managing Schedules

```python
# Get a schedule by ID
schedule = resonate.schedules.get("daily_report")

# Delete a schedule
schedule.delete()
```

**Common Cron Patterns:**
- `"*/5 * * * *"` - Every 5 minutes
- `"0 * * * *"` - Every hour
- `"0 9 * * *"` - Every day at 9am
- `"0 9 * * 1"` - Every Monday at 9am
- `"0 0 * * *"` - Every day at midnight
