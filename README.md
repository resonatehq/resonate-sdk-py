## Distributed Async Await

Resonate's Distributed Async Await is a new programming model that simplifies coding for the cloud. It ensures code completion even if hardware or software failures occur during execution. The programming model does this with just functions and promises, making it trivial to build `coordinated` and `reliable` distributed applications.

## Why Resonate?

- **Cloud Computing Made Dead Simple**: Resonate simplifies coding for the cloud using an intuitive paradigm you already know — async await.

- **Single Binary**: Resonate simplifies your deployment and operations with a single binary.

- **Incremental Adoption and No Vendor Lock-In**: Resonate was designed to allow for incremental adoption without vendor lock-in ever.

- **Built on an Open Standard**: Resonate's programming model is built on top of [durable promises](https://github.com/resonatehq/durable-promise-specification), an open standard with an intentionally minimal API surface area.
