# How to contribute?
Welcome to the Python SDK Resonate project! We appreciate your interest in helping us build reliable and scalable distributed systems. To get started, follow these simple steps:

## Inital setup
We use [rye](https://rye.astral.sh) to manage our python packages. Once installed you can setup the project following this steps:
1. Setup your virtual environment and install dependencies
    ```
    rye sync
    ```
2. Run the tests
    ```
    rye test
    ```

## Documentation
The [docs](./docs/) folder contains resources that explain the core architecture and library design. Please read them, and if you find anything unclear, reach out to us! We are committed to improving them for future contributors.
