# User Authentication Service with Email Confirmation

This application provides a user authentication service that requires email confirmation using FastAPI and Resonate. The service demonstrates an asynchronous workflow where users receive an email confirmation link to complete their authentication process.

Once the promise is resolved, by the user manualy clicking the link in the email, then the workflow is completed.
